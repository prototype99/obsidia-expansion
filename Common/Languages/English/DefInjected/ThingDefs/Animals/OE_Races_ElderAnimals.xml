<!--=============== Elder Direwolf ====================-->  
<OE_Elder_Direwolf.label>elder direwolf</OE_Elder_Direwolf.label>
<OE_Elder_Direwolf.description>Obsidia Direwolves look like normal wolves, but these creatures are nearly twice the size. Because of their fur, they prefer to live in cool climates. Hard to tame, but once tamed, they become loyal protectors.\n\nBut among them, there are legends of a singular Direwolf—one who survived countless winters alone in the frozen wastelands, devouring only the strongest prey and evading every trap laid by hunters. This beast did not just survive—it adapted. Over time, the EGO Seed dormant within its blood awakened, binding to its primal instincts and forming a natural amalgam of ferocity and endurance.\n\nNow known as the Elder Direwolf, this creature is no longer just a predator—it's a force of nature. With reinforced hide, crushing jaws, and a terrifying ability to leap great distances, it embodies the wrath of the tundra itself.\n\nElder Direwolves are even rarer and more dangerous than the typical Direwolf.</OE_Elder_Direwolf.description>

<!--=============== Elder Raptor ====================-->
<OE_Elder_Raptor.label>elder raptor</OE_Elder_Raptor.label>
<OE_Elder_Raptor.description>Raptors are large, aggressive theropods, but seem to be very intelligent for beasts. These theropods prefer to live in warmer climates. Difficult but accessible to taming, which makes these fast and deadly predators an excellent fighting unit.\n\nYet one Raptor was different. After a violent volcanic eruption scorched the southern plains, this lone survivor began to display unnatural agility and heightened aggression. Unbeknownst to observers, the creature had absorbed an EGO Seed buried beneath ancient lava beds—melding it with its own genetic code over years of solitude and constant pursuit.\n\nThe resulting Elder Raptor is a blur of motion and violence. Quicker than the eye, with claws that rend steel and a feral leap that closes any distance in a flash, it is evolution given purpose.\n\nElder Raptors are even rarer and more dangerous than the typical Raptor.</OE_Elder_Raptor.description>

<!--=============== Elder Tionant ====================-->  
<OE_Elder_Tionant_Blue.label>elder tionant (blue)</OE_Elder_Tionant_Blue.label>
<OE_Elder_Tionant_Blue.description>Tionants are the scourge of Obsidia. In ancient times, these creatures terrorized the entire planet, the ancient Obsidia humans worshiped them as gods, but several thousand years ago they disappeared without a trace... But suddenly, a hundred years ago, these creatures again declared themselves. Continuing their terror on the planet. The reason for their disappearance and reappearance is not yet clear, since the Tionants are very difficult to study.\n\nYet one Tionant stood apart—older, darker, and far more silent than its kin. Its presence carries an eerie weight, as if time itself slows in reverence. Witnesses speak of a beast that watches from the edge of the world, patient and knowing, its movements filled with ancient intent. Scholars believe it endured something no other did during the Tionants’ long disappearance—an encounter with a dormant EGO Seed, reshaping its essence without breaking it.\n\nElder Tionants are even rarer and more dangerous than the typical Tionant.\n\nBut despite all this, Tionants have one useful feature. Blue Tionants produce a healing jelly with their bodies.</OE_Elder_Tionant_Blue.description>

<!--=============== Elder Ogren ====================-->  
<OE_Elder_Ogren.label>elder ogren</OE_Elder_Ogren.label>
<OE_Elder_Ogren.description>Obsidia Ogren are huge and very strong creatures. By themselves, they are not aggressive unless disturbed. Their strength allows them to carry huge loads, which makes them excellent pack animals.\n\nBut deep beneath the Obsidian caverns, one Ogren remained untouched by civilization—feeding off minerals rich in psychic residue and absorbing the silent whispers of ancient forces. When the EGO Seed took root in its massive frame, it didn’t resist—it accepted.\n\nNow risen as the Elder Ogren, this titan moves with dreadful purpose. Its blows can shatter stone, and its presence incites terror in nearby foes. What once was a docile giant has become a living bulwark, awakened by raw primal instinct and otherworldly power.\n\nElder Ogrens are even rarer and more dangerous than the typical Ogren.</OE_Elder_Ogren.description>
