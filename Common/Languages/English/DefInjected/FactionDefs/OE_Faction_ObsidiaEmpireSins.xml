<ObsidiaEmpireSins.description>This group of the chosen ones, they saved, protected and inspired the entire Empire, they were a true sword and an unshakable shield for everyone - Obsidia Empire Heroes... But they were called so before, now they are forgotten, rejected and abandoned by their own Empire and the people for whom they did everything - Eidolons... They no longer bathe in the rays of their own glory, but having gained hatred they have found a new goal - themselves.</ObsidiaEmpireSins.description>
